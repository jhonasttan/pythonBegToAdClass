Data Visualization using pyplot
- I've modified the project by using a Jupyter Notebook and adding additional cells for Pandas plot version
- To proceed with Jupyter, first install via pip (if not already installed)
- run command 'jupyter notebook'
- If using PyCharm, you can view your Jupyter Notebook token via terminal using command 'jupyter notebook list'
