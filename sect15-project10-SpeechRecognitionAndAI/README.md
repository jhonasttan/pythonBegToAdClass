Libraries required:
- if mac osx, install portaudio >> 'brew install portaudio'
- pip3 install pyaudio
- pip3 install speechrecognition
Anaconda installs:
- conda install -c pyaudio
- conda install -c conda-forge speechrecognition

Issues: I was not able to resolve conflicts in Anaconda's python3, so instead used local python3 build.
